Quick Replace on Netlify (Drag & Drop)
1) Extract this ZIP to a folder.
2) Netlify → Your Site → Deploys → Drag & drop: select ALL files/folders from this extracted folder (not the ZIP itself).
   - This will overwrite old files. No need to delete separately.
3) Open /admin to log in. (If 404, ensure Identity + Git Gateway are enabled, or deploy from Git repo.)
